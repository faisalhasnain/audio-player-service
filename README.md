## REST API

### Songs

1. Get all songs with optional pagination
```
GET /songs

Query: {
  skip: Number,
  limit: Number
}

Response: {
  id: String,
  title: String,
  filename: String
}
```
2. Get song audio by filename
```
GET /audio/{song-filename.mp3}
```

### Notes
- Songs meta data is being stored in JSON file at the moment. Its not optimal to insert, update and delete individual song records in real world use cases. This will be replaced with proper database in future :)
